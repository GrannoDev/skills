Agent skills by [GrannoDev](https://github.com/GrannoDev).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add GrannoDev/skills
```

Install a single skill:

```bash
npx skills add GrannoDev/skills --skill <name>
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Adding a skill

Each skill is a folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`:

```
skills/<name>/
  SKILL.md        # frontmatter (name, description) + instructions
  references/     # optional: extra docs loaded on demand
  scripts/        # optional: helper scripts
```

`name` must match the folder name. `description` says what the skill does and when to use it; agents read it to decide when to load the skill.
